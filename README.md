# Holiday Destination Planner 

The web page I have created is a Google Maps API. It is a holiday destination planner. As we all know choosing a new city to visit or plan a holiday in can be a daunting task. 
Most families only get to do this once a year so the right decision must be made on picking the right location.
Picking the right area is half the battle but getting as much information on that area is vital to a successful holiday and keeps everybody happy and interested.<br>
The user here can therefore, pick or choose a city of their choice where they may possibly spend their next vacation. 
The web page is compact, concise and gives the user three options they require to gain knowledge of for that individual city. 
They can then make an informed decision on choosing their next holiday destination.
The three options included are, Accommodation, Bars/Restaurants and Tourist Attractions as their points of interest.

## Features

The web page itself is a simple layout and it is more or less self explanatory from looking at your options within the page.
<ul><li>We start with a clearly marked heading which says Choose City. Underneath here we have an autocomplete search box. 
The user chooses the city of their choice which allows them then to choose from the points of interest they require the information for.</li>
<li>Within the points of interest area the user can click on one of three buttons, each a different points of interest.</li>
<li>Once the user chooses their points of interest they get a drop-down list of results, which then populates the map with different location tags which are lettered and which house 
the information they require.</li>
<li>The user then matches the letter on the results list to the map and then they click on the location tag within the map. Doing this
returns the name address telephone number and website of the chosen result.</li>
<li>Once the user has exhausted all results available they can choose the Start Over button to restart the process and go ahead and choose another city to see results for their next choice of city.</li></ul>

#### Future plans include:
<ul><li>The addition of further points of interest.</li></ul>
